/**
 * Who may call a T3 MCP tool. Every handler is built by one of the
 * declarations below, which say what the tool does. `toLayer` accepts only
 * declared handlers and `/mcp` registers only layers `toLayer` built, so a
 * tool without a decision here does not compile.
 *
 * Parameters choose the target; the caller sets the limits: a thread caller
 * its own runtime and interaction modes, an outside client the ceiling it was
 * approved with. Nothing a caller starts or changes may run with broader
 * modes, and a thread caller changes things only while its own run is live.
 * A refusal is an `OrchestratorMcpFailure`, so the compiler requires it in the
 * tool's failure schema, and `ThreadManagementService` in its dependencies.
 *
 * The declaration checks the caller before the handler runs. Handlers still
 * check what only they can see, such as a queued run belonging to its thread.
